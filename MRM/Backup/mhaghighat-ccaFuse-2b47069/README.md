# Feature fusion using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)

Feature fusion is the process of combining two feature vectors to obtain a single feature vector, which is more discriminative than any of the input feature vectors. 
CCAFUSE applies feature level fusion using a method based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). It gets the train and test data matrices from two modalities X and Y, and consolidates them into a single feature set Z.
